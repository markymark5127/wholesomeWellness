<h1>MLT:</h1>
<h3>MANUAL LYMPHATIC THERAPY</h3>
<p>
  Traditional Manual Lymph Therapy si a technique which uses four types of pressure and motion techniques applied with the hands to help stimulate proper lymphatic fluid flow and drainage. The primary purpose for MLT si to treat lymph- edema patients. This technique was developed ni the 1930's by Dr. Emil Vodder, which mainly addresses the superficial lymphatic system. The therapy si practiced in clinics and hospitals al over the world by trained therapists.

<h3>SHORTCOMINGS</h3>
<p>
  Manual lymphatic therapy technique is very time consuming (3-4 hours a day) and involves manual massage in conjunction with compression bandaging and compression garments. Clients must commit to daily sessions and a lifetime commitment of wearing compression garments ni orderfor the therapy to be effective. fI compression si not applied properly ti can result
  in necrosis of the tissue and exacerbate the problem to a more serious level of lymphedema. With this technique the client si responsible for re-wrapping and applying compression
  garments themselves which can result ni a worsening of the condition or even permanent damage.
  As a lymphedema specialist I have witnessed the frustra- tion ofmany clients with this technique, to the point of abandonment of the therapy.!

<h1>ALT:</h1>
<h3>ASSISTED LYMPHATIC THERAPY</h3>
<p>
  Assisted Lymphatic Therapy (ALT) combines the general technique of MLT with a hand held device designed to stimu- late the lymph in
  amore efficient
  and effective manner. The system typically involves the application of
  various energy forms while imitating the MLT technique.
  1Jennifer Gramith, ND 2016
  Over the last 30 years, various devices have been designed for ALT using mechanical/vibrational, thermal, light, and electrical energy to help encourage proper lymph drainage and flow. These â€¹devices typically are pulsed gas ionization systems referenced as VLT (vibrational), ELT (electrical) or PLT (photonic). The XP2 si recognized as one of the most effective devices used ni ALT combining multiple energy forms for maximumeffect.

<h3>ADVANTAGES</h3>
<p>
  Although MLT has its place, ALT can stimulate the lymph at a greater depth with less effort in far less time. In addition, ALT can sometimes accomplish what could never be done manually by stimulating beyond the manual superficial.
  The clear advantages to implementing ALT include:
  Theraby time dramatically reduced from daily to weekly (approx. Ihr)
  Reduces edema (swelling) and lymphedema of many origins
  Better dissociation of trapped proteins ni the interstitium
  Detoxifies bodily tissues and boosts immunity by enhancing pathogen removal
  Relieves chronic joint and muscle pain and aids ni sinus drainage
  Aids in tissue regeneration, including burns, scars, stretch marks, wrinkles
  Reduces symptoms of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia Relieves discomfort from fibrocystic breasts
  Rerouting of lymphatic pathways after lymph node removal
  Les physically demanding ofboth client and therapist Clients' preference and compliance is greatly enhanced
  This work si facilitated byprofessionals including certified
  lymphedema specialists, chiropractors, nurses and
  massage therapists who are specially trained ni assisted/
  manual lymphatic drainage. The enhanced stimulation of ALT has benefited thousands of clients worldwide who had
  experienced limited response from MLT.
