<h1 class="heading">So Who Am I?</h1>
<div>
  <p>I have a Master's degree in Occupational Therapy in which have worked in rehabilitation for 20 plus years. I am also a certified holistic health practitioner.  I have worked with thousands of clients in the hospital, acute rehab, and outpatient rehab settings helping them return to independence after an illness, trauma, or change in their neurological condition.  (Add any special experience, lymph massage? Something unique to reg OTs?)</p>
  <p>My family and I have had our own struggles with illness, declining health and trauma which has led me on this journey of natural health and wellness to which I chose to continue my education for my holistic health certification. I began to research, take courses, and meet other practitioners in the natural medicine field in search of healing. Through my education and experiences, I truly believe that our bodies are made to be able to heal themselves if the conditions are right. I have a passion for whole person wellness and education. From my own experiences, this journey can be hard and it is important to select a practitioner that will listen to your individual concerns. I look forward to collaborating and assisting you in achieving your health and wellness goals in order to feel better and live life to the fullest.</p>
